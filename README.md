# CS362-W2019
Software Engineering (CS 362) class's master repository for Winter 2019.

Week 5
I used Andrew Lee's dominion.c code base to test my unit tests and random test generator functions. The two cards I that I was able to discover bugs in were adventurer and smithy.

The smithy card contained an off by one error while the adventurer card failed to recognize gold as treasure card.
